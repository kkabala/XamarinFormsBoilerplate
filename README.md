# XamarinFormsBoilerplate
XamarinFormsBoilerplate is a starting point for your multiplatform mobile projects, using .NET & Xamarin.Forms.
The main idea why I created that project was to free up programmers from having to write the same boilerplate code in every project.
I'm one of that programmers.
Every time when I'm starting a new project I do the same steps:
- create an application project structure,
- setting up an IoC containers,
- provide database connections,
